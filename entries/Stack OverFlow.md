## History
The website was created by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky in 2008. The name for the website was chosen by voting in April 2008 by readers of *Coding Horror*, Atwood's popular programming blog. On 31 July 2008, Jeff Atwood sent out invitations encouraging his subscribers to take part in the private beta of the new website, limiting its use to those willing to test out the new software. On 15 September 2008 it was announced that the public beta version was in session and that the general public was now able to use it to seek assistance on programming related issues. The design of the Stack Overflow logo was decided by a voting process.
